                    players for 10 months. All of the players he's worked with
                    have loved working with him and really appreciate his
                    ability to break down the fundamentals of winning low-stakes
                    SNGs and MTTs. He's especially adept at helping players
                    master these skills and games so they can move into the
                    mid-stakes. What I really like about working with Grzegorz
                    is how responsive he is to our players and to us. He
                    consistently goes above and beyond what he says he'll do and
                    I'd highly recommend him to anyone struggling at the

                    "I first met wanderer_pro amongst the MTTSNG forum at
                    twoplustwo. He liked my analysis and we have talked strategy
                    on-and-off over a couple of years. He is an example of
                    someone who was beating the games but wasn't happy at
                    standing still, but really dedicating the time into learning
                    how to crush the games. At a time when the games are getting
                    harder and harder to beat, not only is he keeping up with
                    the rest of the field, he is surpassing them. That is not
                    just my opinion, it is evidenced in his graph and winnings
                    over a large sample as you can see for yourself. If you are
                    serious about making money in this industry and improving
                    your play, I would recommend Wanderer as he is very good
                    value-for-money. There are plenty of coaches out there who
                    will charge you much more for a lot less in return. If you
                    want someone to teach you the game, not just say how they
                    would play it, then he is your man. A lot of coaches will
                    have the approach of telling you what they would do,
                    Wanderer will not only do that, but will make you understand
                    why we do things and why it is more profitable with in-depth
                    analysis and breakdowns. Why have a little knowledge about
                    the game, when you could perhaps fully understand it,
                    intead?"

                    "Towards the end of 2019 I had decided to play poker full
                    time again, I had played full time before but had completely
                    stagnated to a point where I was stuck in the same place I
                    always had been with everyone else getting better. Add in a
                    downswing and my love for poker was gone so I got a ‘real’
                    job. I knew that I would need coaching if I wanted to take
                    poker seriously again and fortunately Greg invited me to
                    look at his website so I joined the discord group and
                    arranged some coaching. From the first session the coaching
                    has been to the point effective and enjoyable, the sessions
                    always feel targeted to improve your game by highlighting
                    your biggest leaks. Many of the changes Greg has made took
                    minutes to discuss and have had a huge impact on my game.
                    Greg has been able to make simple solutions to fundamental
                    areas of my game with instant results. Discussing topics is
                    always interesting and Greg will listen to reasonable
                    arguments for exploitative plays. However he will never
                    pander to bad arguments to justify bad plays and is always
                    attentive to why you make certain mistakes above and beyond
                    simply telling you how to play a hand differently. In terms
                    of value I may not be able to compare to other coaches as
                    this is the first time I have been coached, I can however
                    say my results have improved in such a way you can tell
                    exactly when I started working with Greg from them. The
                    coaching has also added confidence to my game In areas I
                    used to be uncomfortable making play everyday much more
                    enjoyable. To summarise the coaching is an extremely high
                    standard for an excellent price and always fun, I would
                    recommend Greg to anyone looking to take poker more
                    seriously. "

                    "I just started playing online poker recently, Wanderer is
                    one of the toughest regs you can find in the lower limits
                    world, I played with him several times, I always looked up
                    to him as a great player, when I found about this coaching
                    platform I contacted him immediately without a second
                    thought. I took the deep review of 10 SNGs that you played
                    deal, Greg takes a lot of his own time to look at your game
                    to identify mistakes and leaks from different stages of the
                    tournament, he also does an amazing job in analyzing your
                    own statistics so you can implement good frequencies on your
                    game. I’m glad I could receive coaching from him, if you are
                    looking to maximize your EV vs regs/recs then Greg is the
                    best man you can find as he shares with you profitable
                    strategies to increase your ROI and exploit the population."

                    "I have been playing poker for approximately 10 years and
                    focusing mainly on MTTs and MTSNGs. Recently I shifted my
                    main focus from MTTs to MTSNGs and asked Wanderer for
                    one-to-one coaching to find and plug leaks in my game. I
                    sent Greg the HHs from some deep runs in MTSNGs and
                    additionally sent statistics (both pre- and postflop) from
                    all my recently played hands in MTSNGS. Wanderer was able to
                    find important leaks as well as exploitative adjustment to
                    be made under certain circumstances. Wanderer has lots of
                    experience in MTSNGS and has a very strong understanding of
                    the fundamentals. For coaching to be effective, it is
                    important that the coach can explain his thoughts clearly
                    and can support it by statistics and the different tools we
                    use to improve our games. Wanderer does this perfectly and
                    as a result I took my MTSNG game to a higher level. All of
                    this, for a very reasonable price. I would recommend
                    Wanderer to anyone who wants to increase their ROI in the

                    online MTT and SNG world. I met Greg in the RYE group and
                    took the opportunity, when he started a smaller and more
                    specialized group for lower limits. Since this day I
                    probably texted every day with him, worked, learned and
                    laughed. I still advise an overall video course, but once
                    you want to go deeper and really work on your personal
                    leaks, one-on-one coaching is the way to go imo and Greg is
                    the perfect guy for that. His results and experience in the
                    lower limits speak for themselves and he can explain to you
                    exactly where to start and what to change in your game, to
                    beat those limits. So many poker players dream of the higher
                    limits, but don't get there, because they never had the
                    patience and someone like Greg, who taught them the basic
                    fundamentals in depth, to build the solid base, from where
                    you can move on."

                    do you still work with sit and goes players?<br>
                    Sit and goes are not my main game currently. I played over 100k multi table sngs in the past, and I think that I can help developing good strategies to beat the field, however I am not playing those stakes/games anymore and I am not familiar with current meta. </p>

                <p>How does coaching work? Can you explain the process step by step?<br>
                    On first session, which usually takes up to an hour, we focus on database research. Your fill in the google doc with your statistics and frequencies from a minimum of 150k hands played. We discuss your tendencies and leaks, compare them to optimal and discuss exploits based on population research that I have done. At the very end, we summarise it with a plan of what you need to be focusing on in terms of studying and what concepts you should start implementing straight away. We develop two different plans: preflop (which you should be studying on your own) and postflop (which we will study together). After your leaks are identified, we schedule more sessions together if you are interested and we focus on 1 aspect of your game at the time.

                    Can you give an example?<br>
                    After DB analysis we found out, that Hero is not VPIPing enough first in from SB, not 3betting enough from the blinds and under defending the BB vs LP openraise. Preflop plan would include studying PF ranges and making sure that after a while we are getting closer to correct frequencies. Postflop DB analysis showed, that Hero is cbetting too often OOP as PFA, not check raising enough both from BB vs LP cbet, as well as when being PFA. We plan our sessions for next couple weeks. Session 1 will be theory behind check raising from BB. This session is done as a power point presentation and GTO+ sims are used to showcase examples. After that, session 2 will be about reviewing hands that Hero played and had opportunity to check raise the flop as BB. We discuss and try to implement new knowledge and double check with postflop simulations. Hero is also adviced to check his check raise freq after addional 100k hands played and see if that freq improved and is getting closer to optimal. The same model is used to conquer cbetting OOP.

                    ever had so far. He found so many leaks in my game and gave
                    me detailed solutions to fix them. The whole review session
                    was all about spots that I have trouble with, sounds pretty
                    savage but in reality it is very helpful and on point. I
                    liked that a lot. During the session, we also talked about
                    the postflop play with the help of a solver, what the
                    villain's range looks like, which hands we should bluff
                    with, which hands we check-raise with, etc. This review made
                    me more thinking player! My winrate improved tremendously
                    and it looks like I've managed to accomplish more in a month

                    of my hands with my most common mistakes and leaks. He also
                    send me a google sheet, where i could fill in my stats of my
                    last 250k hands and then in the coaching, we discussed
                    toghether, where i can play looser or tighter, 3- bet more
                    and so on....wanderer_pro is a very awesome guy, who analyse
                    your exact leaks! He is also able, to explain also difficult
                    spots in an easy way, so that everyone can understand. After
                    his analysis of my stats and games, we had over 3 hours of
                    coaching, where we discussed my leaks, my stats and a lot
                    more things.....he also gave me a lot of advices to push my
                    winrate and he also told me, which programms i should use to

                    other MTT players. Did some review with him and was really
                    impressed with his knowledge of theory and exploits vs
                    player types. While reviewing some of my hands he pointed
                    out a leak of mine as if he was already coaching me while we
                    were just doing HH reviews with about 5 or so people. He is
                    an excellent example of someone who gives value to others
                    and has no respect for leeches in the community. Had an
                    online series coming up and was looking for coaching so I
                    decided to book a few hours with Greg. He really wanted to
                    see where my game was at, further investigate an potential
                    leaks. First session was great and felt like I had all the
                    confidence in the world. He told me what I needed to work on
                    and encouraged me to keeping working harder. I will
                    definitely be looking to work with Greg more in the future
                    as my game continues to progress."

                    "- 'So what do you want to review?' Greg asked me.<br />
                    - 'I want to have a deeper understanding of the theory.' I
                    responded.<br />
                    - 'That's pretty vague man.'<br />
                    He wasn't wrong. However through a combination of my
                    descriptive skills and Greg's talent for breaking down
                    complex theory into understandable concepts; I am continuing
                    to improve at an exponential rate and my win rate really
                    reflects that.<br />
                    When I am not working as a Poker Professional I also work as
                    a private language tutor. I can assure anyone reading this
                    that Greg is an excellent teacher. His knowledge, affability
                    and patience make working with Greg a very organic and
                    enjoyable process. I honestly can't think of anyway to
                    generate more EV in this price range.<br />

                    "I started working with Greg in September of 2019. Due to
                    our schedules not lining up immediately (neither of our
                    faults) we took some time getting together, and when we did
                    I couldn’t have been happier to begin working. His approach
                    to the game is very sound and straightforward. You can tell
                    he’s no amateur, and knows what he is talking about. He was
                    able to find leaks in my game, and gave me specifics to
                    focus on in the beginning. I don’t get to play much now, but
                    will facilitate the knowledge given to me in the future and
                    hope to be able to build off of it to produce the player I
                    want to be. I’m really thankful that I’ve gotten to work
                    with him and would recommend him to any player looking for
                    improvement in their game."

                    "Greg has put in a lot of work and has modern approach to
                    studying the game. He uses GTO as base strategy and
                    understands how to implement it at the tables based on
                    population tendencies and actions. I really respect his
                    dedication and work ethics. He understands how important it
                    is to work on game off table and really has put in the hours
                    to have structurized gameplan. Also he gives back to
                    comunity by gathering hardworking players together to work
                    on game and help each other improve. I guess you can say he
